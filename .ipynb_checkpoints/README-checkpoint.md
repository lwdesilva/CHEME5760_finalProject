# CHEME 5760 Final Project
The increase in demand for reliable, diverse energy
sources and the improvement of solar technologies has created
a heightened demand for residential PV retrofits in the past
decade[3]. Deciding to invest in solar PV is complex and is
influenced by housing markets, incentive programs, local grid
infrastructures and several personal preferences[3]. This paper
explores how to use utility models, such as the Cob-Douglass,
to help quantitatively inform the choice between Solar PV vs.
Solar Heating. The utility function accounts for 7 preferences and
generates a prediction that maximizes utility. The tool developed
in this study also examines how an individualâ€™s risk aversion im-
pacts expected utility, applying this insight to decisions regarding
the purchase of additional house insurance coverage. While the
tool efficiently simplifies complex decision processes with multiple
considerations, it is essential to acknowledge its simplification of
real-world uncertainties and potential limitations in capturing all
preferences and risk attitudes that could influence this decision.
